# Practice React by fixing tests - Check your JSX knowledge!

Working with JSX involves:

- displaying info from variables - strings, objects
- using Javascript expressions inside JSX
- converting HTML to JSX
- knowing the JSX rules - e.g. only one root element etc.

Where do you think you stand?
Check your knowledge by fixing these failing unit tests!

## Getting started

1. Run `npm install`
2. Open the test file: `src/__tests__/jsx-exercises.test.jsx`
3. Run the tests `npm run test`
4. Fix them!

Tips:

- replace `test("bla")` with `test.only("bla")` to run only that test
- move the console section with the test results to the right side of the code editor, so it's side by side with the code
- for an even better test experience in VSCode, install the [Jest](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest) extension
